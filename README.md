- **HR Dashboard**: HR can manage employees, approve/reject leave requests, assign projects, and monitor overall statistics.
- **Leave Management**:
  - Employees can submit leave requests (casual, sick, LOP).
  - View leave balances, pending requests, and monthly trends.
  - Track leave history with filtering by month/year.
- **Project & Task Management**:
  - HR can create projects and assign employees.
  - Employees can view assigned projects and tasks.
  - Task creation, assignment, and status tracking.
- **UI Components**:
  - Reusable components for tables, dialogs, charts, and forms.
  - Loading spinners and toast notifications for feedback.
- **Hooks & Services**:
  - Custom hooks for authentication and data fetching.
  - Service files for API communication (leave, project, task).

#### How to Use (Frontend)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Access the app**: Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### üóÑÔ∏è Backend Functionality

The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** (via Mongoose). It provides RESTful APIs for all core features.

#### Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - JWT-based login for employees and HR.
  - Middleware for route protection and role-based access.
- **Employee Management**:
  - CRUD operations for employee records.
  - HR can view, add, update, or remove employees.
- **Leave Management**:
  - Employees can submit leave requests.
  - HR can approve/reject requests.
  - Leave balances are tracked and updated per month.
  - Endpoints for fetching leave history, balances, and trends.
- **Project & Task Management**:
  - HR can create projects and assign employees.
  - Tasks can be created, assigned, and updated.
  - Employees can view their assigned projects and tasks.
- **Category Management**:
  - HR can manage employee categories (departments, roles).
- **Utilities & Middleware**:
  - Error handling, async wrappers, and custom response utilities.
  - Seeders for initial data population.

#### How to Use (Backend)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.
3. **Seed initial data (optional)**:
   ```bash
   node seeders/categorySeeder.js
   ```
4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **API Endpoints**:
   - Auth: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
   - Employees: `/api/employees`
   - Leave: `/api/leave`
   - Projects: `/api/projects`
   - Tasks: `/api/tasks`
   - Categories: `/api/categories`

### üîó How Frontend & Backend Work Together

- The frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints for all data operations.
- JWT tokens are used for authentication; tokens are stored in local storage and sent with each request.
- Leave requests, project assignments, and task updates are reflected in real-time via API calls and state updates.
